			The internet is an important part of our lives. So important, that in 2016, the UN declared it a human right on the basis of the freedom of expression.
			<br><br>

			Expression can be defined as “an act, process, or instance of representing in a medium”. Under this definition, webart can be considered a form of expression. 
			<br><br>

			In Paul Graham’s words, “hacking and painting have a lot in common”. The end goal of each activity is simply to create for a human audience.
			<br><br>

			Take this webpage for example. I can recreate the webpage in such a way that it now looks like this	and	this. I can even add this too. And while we’re at it, why not add 
			this, this, and this.

			And before you know it, you have a Christmas themed website, conveying my excitement and love for the festive holiday for any internet user to access. Ideas don’t even have to be as concrete as this website. One can make a more abstract form of art like

			<a href="drawing.html" id="this7" target="_blank">this</a>

			too.
		
			<!-- <p><a onclick="moveAgain();" id="this7" href="javascript:void(0)">THIS</a>.</p> -->

			The block page that you just experienced is connected to the current threats towards net neutrality in the United States.
			<br><br>
			The basic premise of net neutrality is that all data is created equal. This means that governments, media companies, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should not be offering any preferential treatment to certain content that is transmitted over the Internet. 
			<br><br>

			Those in favor of net neutrality say that whether you are streaming HD videos, downloading music, or creating and uploading a website you created, you should be able to get the same internet speed all around.
			<br><br>

			However, in the modern world today, capitalistic countries such as the United States have various internet service providers that are trying to repeal the idea of net neutrality so they may gain more profit.
			<br><br>

			In the United States, network providers such as AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast, want to stop net neutrality because then they’ll have the ability to control the speed of the internet for whichever site they want. Thus, sites that have slow internet speed will  need to pay these companies extra because they’ll want to get out of this “slow lane”.
			<br><br>

			In extension to this theme of repealing the idea of net neutrality, it is like taking away one's freedom of using the internet and thus consequently limiting one’s ability to “express” themselves online. For example, if one were to upload a website he or she has created with an ISP for priority access, then uploading that content with that ISP would be a great experience. However, if one doesn’t have this ISP service, then one is subjected to waiting hours to upload his or her’s content. Essentially, it restricts people’s ability to create art and express it in a faster way.
			<br><br>

			At this point of reading, you have probably noticed that much of the artwork and designs on this webpage have either disappeared or stopped working, in addition to the block and pop-ups you’ve also experienced. This deterioration was meant to symbolize the threat towards a creator’s right to use the internet in its free form now. With net neutrality repealed, users will not have the ability to express themselves and use the free, limitless accessessible websites and functions like we do now.
